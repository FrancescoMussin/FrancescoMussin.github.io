Throughout my academic carreer I have been making LaTeX notes on essentially every course I took. This was a way to store everything I needed to know digitally. Too much later I realized that the best way to do that was with a site, so here we are: no more phisical notebooks or tex files that aren't stored on all my devices, here I can access everything I want.

## Notes from courses from my bachelor's studies

This is a collection of LaTeX notes taken from courses taught at UniMiB when I was a mathematics Bachelor's student. ***They are only available in italian*** as that was the language of instruction of the material.
